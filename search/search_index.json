The goal is to ensure that research outputs from DIME are fully reproducible. To complete this review, please complete the Code Review Checklist and submit it and the replication materials to dimeanalytics@worldbank.org alongside the submission of the working paper to the peer review process (currently organized by Dan Rogger). Please include the completed checklist as an exhibit or appendix to your working paper, since these materials directly attest to the transparency and credibility of your research project. The Analytics team will get back to you within two weeks of receiving the complete package. We will edit only the top-level directory global in the master do-file and run it to reproduce the results. We will make sure that your files run and that the raw outputs are re-created exactly as you supplied them; and if possible we will check them against the publication to confirm no transcription errors. For your review, we will return a list of specific replicability or execution errors if any occur, as well as general suggestions for code improvements and places where existing programs can save time and effort for your future work. We are happy to provide more specific suggestions to your team for improving the function and readability of the code if you have questions. Public Release Once this is complete, we can help to organize a public release repository on GitHub ( such as this example ). Let us know if you would like to do this and we are happy to help you set this up.

If you want to know what either of these two things are, please read the rest of this page. You need a GitHub.com account. If you do not already have one, create a free account here . After you have done so, send your username to the team with the repository you want to be invited to as a collaborator, or send it to the person organizing the beginner training you intend to attend. You need to install a Git \"client\" on your computer. There are many clients to choose from and almost all of them are free. Which one you choose does not matter from a technical perspective, but in the beginner training we will show how to do things using the client GitHub Desktop which is free to use. If you already now know that you intend to use Git extensively, please read the section on Git clients below. If you are a World Bank employee and either want to access the features in the World Bank's paid enterprise account (we recommend you do so), or if you want to create your own repository within the World Bank's account, see the World Bank GitHub Group section below. If you are helping to organize a Git training with DIME Analytics, see this checklist . What is Git and what is needed to use Git? Git is a tool that solves almost any code collaboration challenge you can think of. It is such a successful tool that all the code in all the software you are using to browse the internet and read this text right now is developed in Git. Recently, tools have been developed that make it easier to use Git for researchers like us who collaborate on code, but do not have time to learn the technical tools that computer scientists use. While Git can be used in many ways, a research project usually depends on Git, a cloud host for Git (GitHub.com), and a Git client. This is not more complicated than the fact that your organization's email depends on an underlying email protocol, a cloud host for your emails (webmail) and a desktop client that lets you write emails. See this comparison in the image below. You will eventually use Git/GitHub for more things than this, but for a beginner this is a good model to explain the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git clients. Each item is explained in more detail below. Git DIME projects are encouraged to use Git, a free version control software , for writing and collaborating on data analysis code. Git allows simultaneous editing and execution of code files and very detailed comparisons of histories and alternate versions. This enables maintaining and merging simultaneous ongoing workstreams without conflicts, unlike software like Dropbox. You do not need to understand how Git works to start using it. Our trainings are designed to introduce you gradually to the features you need to understand. If you are a beginner, you only need to know how Git and GitHub are different things. GitHub GitHub is one out of many web services that can host the master copy of files you manage using Git. GitHub is the largest of those services, which is good if you want people to see your code and maybe even contribute to it. But you can also decide to keep your code private and only show it to people you decide to invite to your project. The World Bank has a team subscription to this which you can join ( see below ) and that way get access to paid features. One GitHub alternative World Bank staff can use to create and manage your own remote Git repositories is Microsoft Azure DevOps . You can create your repository there without any approvals using your World Bank email to login, although some features, like external collaboration, does not exist there. Git Clients There are many desktop Git clients you can use to interact with the master copy of your Git files hosted on the web, but GitHub Desktop and GitKraken are two clients supported on World Bank computers. GitHub Desktop is simple and therefore used in our training for absolute beginners, but we recommend anyone who intend to work a lot in Git to start using a more advanced Git client like GitKraken, although there is a subscription required to work with private repositories. Different people in the same project can use different clients, so a PI that only uses Git occasionally can use GitHub Desktop, at the same time an RA use GitKraken. DIME Analytics offers regular Git trainings as well as on-demand onboardings for teams and PIs and can help you get this software up and running. World Bank GitHub Group DIME team members can join the World Bank GitHub group to have access to premium features. To join this group, you must first have a GitHub account. Create a GitHub account If you do not already have a GitHub account, open one at this link . While you can use any email address, we recommend using a personal email when you sign up so that you do not lose access to your GitHub account in case you were to change jobs. There is no need to create a second account if you already signed up using a work email as you can add multiple secondary email addresses to your account, and later change which address is your primary email address. But we are recommending using a personal email when signing up in the first place, as we have had people lose access to their GitHub account after changing employer when using a work email as primary email. Join the World Bank GitHub group This only applies to people with an active employment contract with the World Bank (although it includes anything from Staff, ETC, STC, to internship). Complete the World Bank GitHub.com Pilot MOU below by copying it to an email and filling in your information in the end of the MOU. Then email it from your World Bank email address to the World Bank GitHub team at github@worldbank.org with the subject line \"Request to Join World Bank GitHub Group - [YOUR NAME]\". When the GitHub team have received your request and checked that it is in order they will add you to the group. You will then get a notification from GitHub.com to your email saying that you have been invited to the World Bank GitHub group. If you have been invited but you did not receive the invitation (the email got deleted or ended up in junk folder etc.) then you can always got o github.com/worldbank and if you have a invitation waiting for you to join the World Bank GitHub group, then you will be prompted to accept the invitation at the top of the page. Finally and optionally, if you want it to show on your profile page on GitHub that you are a member of the World Bank GitHub Group, then got to https://github.com/orgs/worldbank/people and search for your username, and make sure that Public is selected instead of Private . World Bank Group Staff GitHub.com Pilot MOU: I am aware that I am requesting access to the World Bank Group's GitHub.com group and any associated public and private repositories within that group. I am aware that GitHub.com is an open source platform and that potentially any data uploaded could become available to the public. I am aware that private repositories should be for working drafts of non-sensitive information only that are not yet ready for public viewing. I agree not to post any confidential or sensitive information on any public or private GitHub.com repository. I agree not to make public any repository without first consulting github@worldbank.org, and following any procedures then suggested. I agree that I will comply with all relevant copyright laws and will not post copyrighted material to which I do not have release to do so. I agree to maintain backups of any data I upload into a repository locally, and that these are updated at least once a month while the project is still active. I agree that upon my departure of World Bank Group employment that I will remove any associated worldbank.org email addresses associated with my account, and notify github@worldbank.org of my departure. I agree that I will keep my password secure; I will not share the user account with others and will not delegate administrative capabilities to non-World Bank Group staff. I certify that I have read all the above and agree to the World Bank Group\u2019s rules for accessing its GitHub.com repositories. Name: Github account name: Creating a repository within the World Bank GitHub group To create a repository in the World Bank GitHub group, send the following email to your manager and to github@worldbank.org with the subject line \"Approval Required: Create GitHub Repository [NAME]\". Hi [MANAGER], can you please approve the following request for GitHub repository creation: Repository Name: Repository Description/Purpose: Team Name: Team Maintainer: I am aware that my employee named above as \"Team Maintainer\" is requesting creation of a code repository in the World Bank Group's Github.com site, for the purpose described above. This site allows for the publishing and public consumption of reproducible research and code. I agree that I have read the rules applicable to such access and agree to assist in upholding them to the best of my ability. Manager's Name: The manager should reply to the email with a confirmation of approval and the GitHub team will then notify you when the repository is open. Repositories are private by default. If your repository will contain research code that is not ready to be shared with the world (e.g. data cleaning, exploratory analysis), you'll probably want to keep it that way. If the content of the repository can be public, it's occasionally easier to create it using your personal account. However, if you are creating a repo to share commands, or templates, or apps created as part of your project, or the replication folder for a paper, you may want it to be linked to the World Bank group so people can find it without having to look for your username. Joining a repository hosted in the World Bank GitHub group as a external collaborator This does only apply to anyone who does not have an active contract with the World Bank. If you do have a active contract, then follow the steps for how to join the World Bank GitHub group and then this step is not needed. If you are an external collaborator, then follow these steps: Copy the MOU below to an email and after reading it, fill in your information at the end of the MOU. Then send that email to your World Bank counterpart who is an repo admin of the repository you want to be added to. The World Bank repo admin should then forward this email to github@worldbank.org from their World Bank email address. When the World Bank repo admin gets a confirmation from the World Bank GitHub team that everything was received in order, then the World Bank repo admin can invite the external collaborator to the repository. External Collaborator Github.com Pilot MOU: 1. I am aware that I am requesting access to the World Bank Group's GitHub.com group and any associated public and private repositories within that group. 2. I am aware that GitHub.com is an open source platform and that potentially any data uploaded could become available to the public. 3. I am aware that private repositories should be for working drafts of non-sensitive information only that are not yet ready for public viewing. 4. I agree not to post any confidential or sensitive information on any public or private GitHub.com repository. 5. I agree not to make public any repository. 6. I agree that I will comply with all relevant copyright laws and will not post copyrighted material to which I do not have release to do so. 7. I agree to maintain backups of any data I upload into a repository locally, and that these are updated at least once a month while the project is still active. 8. I agree that I will keep my account username and password secure and will not share the user account with others. I certify that I have read all the above and agree to the World Bank Group\u2019s rules for accessing its GitHub.com repositories.

While Git can be used in many ways, a research project usually depends on Git, a cloud host for Git (GitHub.com), and a Git client. This is not more complicated than the fact that your organization's email depends on an underlying email protocol, a cloud host for your emails (webmail) and a desktop client that lets you write emails. See this comparison in the image below. You will eventually use Git/GitHub for more things than this, but for a beginner this is a good model to explain the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git clients. Each item is explained in more detail below.","title":"What is Git and what is needed to use Git?"},{"location":"git/#git","text":"DIME projects are encouraged to use Git, a free version control software , for writing and collaborating on data analysis code. Git allows simultaneous editing and execution of code files and very detailed comparisons of histories and alternate versions. This enables maintaining and merging simultaneous ongoing workstreams without conflicts, unlike software like Dropbox. You do not need to understand how Git works to start using it. Our trainings are designed to introduce you gradually to the features you need to understand. If you are a beginner, you only need to know how Git and GitHub are different things.","title":"Git"},{"location":"git/#github","text":"GitHub is one out of many web services that can host the master copy of files you manage using Git. GitHub is the largest of those services, which is good if you want people to see your code and maybe even contribute to it. But you can also decide to keep your code private and only show it to people you decide to invite to your project. The World Bank has a team subscription to this which you can join ( see below ) and that way get access to paid features. One GitHub alternative World Bank staff can use to create and manage your own remote Git repositories is Microsoft Azure DevOps . You can create your repository there without any approvals using your World Bank email to login, although some features, like external collaboration, does not exist there.","title":"GitHub"},{"location":"git/#git-clients","text":"There are many desktop Git clients you can use to interact with the master copy of your Git files hosted on the web, but GitHub Desktop and GitKraken are two clients supported on World Bank computers. GitHub Desktop is simple and therefore used in our training for absolute beginners, but we recommend anyone who intend to work a lot in Git to start using a more advanced Git client like GitKraken, although there is a subscription required to work with private repositories. Different people in the same project can use different clients, so a PI that only uses Git occasionally can use GitHub Desktop, at the same time an RA use GitKraken. DIME Analytics offers regular Git trainings as well as on-demand onboardings for teams and PIs and can help you get this software up and running.","title":"Git Clients"},{"location":"git/#world-bank-github-group","text":"DIME team members can join the World Bank GitHub group to have access to premium features.

While you can use any email address, we recommend using a personal email when you sign up so that you do not lose access to your GitHub account in case you were to change jobs. There is no need to create a second account if you already signed up using a work email as you can add multiple secondary email addresses to your account, and later change which address is your primary email address.

Dropbox DIME members are allowed to utilize Dropbox on personal and World Bank computers. Contact DIME Analytics to request an installation on a Bank machine, or start using your personal machine right away. Videoconferencing The World Bank provides a WebEx subscription to all staff. You can access your account at the corporate WebEx portal using your logon token. You can also use the desktop and mobile apps on Bank or personal machines without additional restriction. This is a more reliable way to have video conferences than, for example, Google Hangouts or Skype. The people you invite do not need an account, there is localized dial-in and dial-out capacity in many countries, and by inviting World Bank conference rooms (see the WebEx portal) the videoconference (VC) equipment in the room connects automatically once the meeting time starts. Remote Access to Bank Virtual Machines The World Bank Citrix system can provide two functions. First, it can access a virtual World Bank desktop from any personal computer. These instructions are below. Second, it also be set up by ITS to provide a secure and powerful server interface for your team to store and analyze data using Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). Contact DIME Analytics for more information. You are able to access a virtual World Bank desktop from any personal computer using Citrix Workspace . This is close to, but not exactly the same, as you logging in to your World Bank desktop. The difference is that you will not have access to any software installed on your desktop in a local drive (for example Stata) and you will not have access to files saved locally (for example in the Documents folder). The virtual desktop behaves as if you are logging in to a new World Bank computer for the first time. You will not have your local files, but you will have access to networks, OneDrive access, Intranet, etc. that you have from World Bank desktops. To login to a Virtual Desktop, follow the following steps: Download the Citrix software for the device you are using (PC, Mac etc.) After the download is complete, open the software and follow its instructions. When you are asked to enter an \"email or server address\", enter: myconnect.wbg.org Then you will be asked to enter your UPI (in the format wb123456 ), the Windows password for your World Bank computer, and the passcode you are using for your token. If you are using an email token you will get one more window asking you to enter the code sent to your email. After you are logged in you will get to a menu where you can select which software you are accessing. You can also click \"Desktop\" to access a virtual version of a World Bank computer. (OPTIONAL) If you know the property number of your WB computer(small silver sticker with a 7 digit number), then you can access your own World Bank desktop and local files. Click on the \"Bookmark\" button at the top right of the \"Desktops\" page. On the new window that pops up, in the row labeled 'URL' , put \"PC\" followed by the property number. For example - PC1234567 if your property number is 1234567. In the 'Name' row, put a name such as \"World Bank desktop\" and click \"Save\". Now double click on the new \"World Bank desktop\" icon to launch your remote desktop. If you have never logged in on a World Bank computer and therefore do not have a Windows password yet, you should call IT support on 32121 from any World Bank phone, or +1-202-473-2121 from any phone. Stata & R The World Bank has a Stata MP license for use on Bank computers available for purchase. R and RStudio are free, and we additionally have RStudio Server and Shiny installations we can provide access to. Contact DIME Analytics for details. SurveyCTO DIME Analytics administers the World Bank's enterprise subscription with SurveyCTO . This installation is available to all Bank teams at a discount from the retail subscription and uses Bank single-sign-on when possible as well as allowing external email accounts. Please review the World Bank SurveyCTO Documentation and use eServices to request a server. To be added to the DIME Team for survey template sharing, please contact DIME Analytics. Git & GitHub DIME projects are encouraged to use Git , a free version control software , for writing data analysis code. They allow simultaneous editing and execution of code files and comparisons of hisotries and alternate versions. This enables maintaining and merging simultaneous ongoing workstreams without conflicts, unlike software like Dropbox. Learn more here. LaTeX LaTeX is a text-based typesetting language. It can support full version control with Git, simultaneous online editing, or collaboration over Git/GitHub. Overleaf is an online collaborative LaTeX editor that works much like Google Docs and includes a very useable rich-text editor. TeXStudio is a desktop-based suite that works well with Git and is available for self-installation. Both allow the use of BibTeX for reference management, which pandoc can translate into correctly cited Microsoft Word documents (and much more!) using the Citation Styles library : pandoc -s -o main.docx main.tex --bibliography sample.bib --csl=/.../styles/the-lancet.csl Security and Data Encryption Password Managers Using a password manager is the most commonly recommended best practice for normal internet users (see examples here , here or here ) and should be used by everyone. They can generate and store strong passwords for your accounts, when you will need to use various logon names for personal and official business. LastPass is a popular and free password manager. It is most important that you are using any password manager, but the World Bank provides a free subscription to the premium features in LastPass for you. Visit the LastPass Premium Partner Page to set up access. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) If you combine two-factor authentication with a password managers then your life on the web is as secure as it could possibly be. The main drawback of most two-factor authentication methods is that it only works if you have your cell phone with you and it is charged. 2FA is required for most Bank-provided services via a logon token that is emailed to you whenever you attempt to access a secure service. However, you should also protect your personal accounts, since they may contain sensitive personal or financial information. Authy is one exampe of a free software that enables two-factor authentication on your personal accounts. Setup is via Authy for Apple iOS and Authy for Android . Shared Drive (DropBox etc.) encryption VeraCrypt is a free encryption software that creates and manages \"virtual thumb drives\" that are inaccessible without a password. It can be used on World Bank machines to store and transfer sensitive data. Contact DIME Analytics for training. Atom Text and Code Editor Atom is a powerful free text editor that has easy integrations with Git/GitHub and Stata, as well as other languages and softwares like LaTeX and Markdown. You can set it up on a personal computer with administration privileges. We are currently working on setup instructions for World Bank computers. First install Atom from https://atom.io/ . Choose any theme you like! In Atom, go to Settings and then Install and install the following two packages language-stata and stata-exec . In Settings / Packages , open stata-exec and read the instructions carefully. For Mac users : Selecting the correct Stata version should be the only step. Ask for help if you don't understand something. For Windows users : It is a bit more complicated. You need to follow these instructions. Ask for help if you don't understand something. Now open a Stata .do file in Atom and run it using the keyboard shortcuts in the stata-exec settings. The default keyboard shortcuts are slightly different than in the Stata dofile editor: shift-cmd-d (on Macs) and shift-ctrl-d (on PC) runs the whole file, and cmd-alt-d (on Macs) and ctrl-alt-d (on PC) runs only the selected code block. Let us know if you want to change these! Useful Atom Packages: file-icons : Adds icons to the project sidebar. fonts : Supports beautiful programming fonts like atom-firacode . chary-tree-view : Stops Atom from trying to open .dta and .xlsx files. indent-guide-improved : Helps you understand the structure of your code and be a better coder. minimap : Shows you a zoomed-out view of your code so you can navigate faster. zebra-stripes : Makes alternating lines different colors in the editor (very good for coding). language-latex : Provides code highlighting for LaTeX. latex : Compile LaTeX documents with Atom. (Atom can therefore replace TeXStudio also.) hydrogen : See Stata results directly in your code. This is an advanced feature and we are happy to help you set this up. teletype : Work on the same code file at the same time with any number of other people.

To start a SurveyCTO survey, visit eServices and submit a request for \u201c SurveyCTO Data Collection Platform \u201d. Requests are fulfilled within 1 business day. Each request becomes a group on the WBG SurveyCTO Enterprise server. Cost and Server Limits The cost is $99 per month per group. Each group is allowed up to 30 forms (i.e. questionnaires), 10,000 mobile submissions, 10,000 web submissions, and 2GB of storage. In eServices, the requestor will designate a \u2018Survey Administrator\u2019 for their survey. This person must have a World Bank Group email address for authentication purposes. The Survey Administrator will receive an email as soon as their group is live on the server, at which point they will be able to log on and add all other team members and assign them the appropriate profile. The additional team members can be WBG staff and consultants or trusted external partners, who will then receive an invitation to the server. WBG users will be automatically authenticated; externals will be asked to create a password on their first visit. Access and Roles The Survey Administrator will be able to manage (add/delete) users, forms, and data for their group. New users can be added using the \u201cConfigure\u201d tab. Each new user must be assigned a role, which will determine what access the user has to the server. The following standard roles are available for all groups: Form and Data Managers: can upload, move, and remove survey forms; can view and export data. Cannot manage users. Data Managers: can view and export data. Cannot manage forms or users. Enumerators: can view forms and submit questionnaires. Cannot manage users or forms, or access data. Custom roles are available on request. Help and Customer Support Extensive documentation and resources are available through the \u201cHelp\u201d menu on the server. You can download the WBG Enterprise SurveyCTO documentation here . Questions regarding the software itself (e.g. programming challenges, questions on particular features) should be addressed to SurveyCTO through the Support Center. Please make Support Center requests through the SurveyCTO server. Questions regarding the WBG Enterprise set-up specifically (start a new survey, request custom roles, etc) can be addressed to dimeanalytics@worldbank.org . Sync Client The SurveyCTO Sync Desktop application can be installed on WBG computers by local IT. To request it, use the \u201c Software Installation Request \u201d in eServices and select \u2018SurveyCTO\u2019 in the Software Catalogue. You can also download the Sync client, and license, here . Documentation, as well as sync clients for non-Windows operating systems, are available here . \u200bUnzip the file that downloads from that link. Place SurveyCTO_Sync.exe into C:/WBG/ , and then copy the client.lic file into the \u201cSurveyCTO Sync Storage\u201d folder if authentication fails. By default, this folder usually ends up in Documents, but users may want to put it elsewhere. If you can't find it, open Sync, and then before trying to enter any passwords press \"Tools\" in the menubar, open Preferences, and you will be able to see where the storage folder is located. Once the file is located the folder, the user will drop the client.lic file into the folder and try to open Sync again. Then, the user will be able to close the pop-up without Sync closing. Important Notes Because this is an enterprise installation, you are sharing server space with all other surveys.

The only advantage of the advanced method is that you can see the final formatted HTML version of the website before you send us your edits. In the easy method you will only see the text in markdown format until we have deployed the update for you. If you want to just add a sentence or fix a typo, then you will be perfectly fine using the easy method. It should also be fine if you are adding a new paragraph as well. However, if you are adding a table, a new page or something big like that, then you should consider using the advanced method so you can see the rendered result before submitting a pull request. Which files to edit Regardless if you are using the easy or the advanced method, the files you need to edit are exactly the same. In this repo you will find a folder called /_MkDocs/ and inside that folder you find a folder called /docs/ that contains all the markdown files -- the text that goes into the HTML version of the website. In the docs folder you see one file for each page on the DIME Analytics website . They are named in a way that you should be able to figure out which file includes the text for the page you want to edit or add to. The easy method of contributing The easy method might not be that easy if you are not familiar with GitHub, as the page uses GitHub's functionality to keep track of contributions. If you know what branches and pull requests are, then this should be easy for you. You can either edit the files on GitHub.com in the browser or download (clone) the repo to your computer and use a code editor. In both these methods you will need a GitHub account. Editing in browser on GitHub.com If you are editing the file on GitHub.com then just go to that file and make edits to the content. When you are saving (committing) your work, GitHub.com will either create a fork on your account or branch in this repo (depending if you are in the DIME Team at the World Bank's GitHub account). When you are done editing, submit a pull request from the fork or branch that GitHub created to the master branch in this repository, and we will review and publish your edits. Editing in code editor on your computer Clone the repository and create a branch. If you are not in DIME Team at the World Bank's GitHub account then you will have to fork the repository first. Edit the files you want to edit. Commit and push to the cloud and then submit a pull request to the master branch in this repository and we will review your edits, and upload them. The advanced method of contributing The main benefit of this method is that you can render the website on your local computer and look at the final result as you are making your edits. This is great if you are experimenting with some advanced formatting. This website is built using the command line tool MkDocs using the theme Material . You need to install both the tool and the theme to be able to render the website locally. They are easy to install if you have pip installed on your computer. The MkDocs guide has a less technical guide about installing pip . Once you have pip installed you install mcdocs and mkdocs-material like this using your command line , terminal window, bash or any other console. pip install mkdocs pip install mkdocs-material Next step is to clone this repository if you have not already done so. Go to the folder /_MkDocs/docs/ folder to find the files you want to edit. Make your edits and save the files. If you want to see the result of your edits before sending them to us, then do the following: Open an console window ( command line , terminal , bash etc.) and make sure that you are in the /_MkDocs/ folder in the repository in the branch where you have saved your edits. If you are not in the right place, nothing will happen (unless you are in another folder with a _mkDocs website), so do not be afraid to test if you are not sure. In that folder, run this in your console mkdocs build . This should create another folder /_MkDocs/site/ with many sub-folders. In the /site/ folder you should also find a file called index.html . Click that file and it should open as a webpage in your default browser. If you click on any link you will not get to the next page immediately since you are browsing the files locally and that works slightly different. What will happen depends on your browser or if you are using a Mac or a PC. In Safari on a Mac, for example, you are taken to a folder in the /site/ folder in finder where you will find another index.html file that you can click on to get to the page the link was pointing to. In Google Chrome on a PC you will get to a page that looks like the image below. There you click on the index.html link and you will get to the link destination.

Those branches are locked so that only WB account admins and @bbdaniels and @kbjarkefur can edit them. Everyone else should make their edits and submit a pull request to the master branch. When new edits have been merged to the master branch then do the following: Build the website using mkdocs build and make sure that the new edits has not broken anything on the website.
