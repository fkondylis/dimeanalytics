DIME Analytics supports research workflows and best practices at DIME and creates public goods to increase the research quality for impact evaluation and development economics generally. In 2016, DIME staff supervised 15 baseline surveys and 22 follow-up surveys representing over $7.5 million in client executed funds. DIME Analytics supports DIME projects directly through training, code review and reproducibility support, and technology solutions.

We take advantage of the concentration and scale of research at DIME to develop and test solutions, first to ensure high quality of data collection and research quality across our portfolio, and, second, to make public training and tools available to the larger community of development researchers who might not have the same capabilities. The resulting products are offered to the development research community at large through software releases, structured trainings and the DIME Wiki, a comprehensive wiki with resources on all phases of impact evaluation.

Our team gathers, documents, standardizes and disseminates these produces and practices to (1) ensure that all DIME surveys follow established best practices in data analysis and research transparency and (2) keep tools, protocols, guidelines, and training materials publicly available and up-to-date in a rapidly changing field.

[The custom version of the Sync client required for downloading data is available here.](http://ed10desktop.worldbank.org/default.asp?category=packages&page=packageview&pkgno=AWBG10177)

## World Bank GitHub

DIME-based projects are encouraged to use Git, a [version control](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668) software, for maintaining code projects. To support this, DIME team members can join the [World Bank GitHub group](https://github.com/worldbank/), and the desktop clients [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) and [GitKraken (recommended)](https://www.gitkraken.com) are supported on World Bank computers. They allow simultaneous editing and execution of code files, including merging workstreams without conflicts, unlike Dropbox.
Here's how to sign up:

**1. Create a GitHub account**

- If you do not already have a GitHub account, open one at [this link](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). You don't need to use your World Bank e-mail and you can use an account you already have to become a member of this group.

**2. Join the World Bank GitHub group**

- Complete the World Bank GitHub.com Pilot MOU below, and email it to the World Bank GitHub team at [github@worldbank.org](mailto:github@worldbank.org) with the subject line "Request to Join World Bank GitHub Group - [YOUR NAME]". They will add you to the group and notify you.

```
World Bank Group Staff GitHub.com Pilot MOU:

I am aware that I am requesting access to the World Bank Group's GitHub.com group and any associated public and private repositories within that group.
I am aware that GitHub.com is an open source platform and that potentially any data uploaded could become available to the public.
I am aware that private repositories should be for working drafts of non-sensitive information only that are not yet ready for public viewing.
I agree not to post any confidential or sensitive information on any public or private GitHub.com repository.
I agree not to make public any repository without first consulting github@worldbank.org, and following any procedures then suggested.
I agree that I will comply with all relevant copyright laws and will not post copyrighted material to which I do not have release to do so.
I agree to maintain backups of any data I upload into a repository locally, and that these are updated at least once a month while the project is still active.
I agree that upon my departure of World Bank Group employment that I will remove any associated worldbank.org email addresses associated with my account, and notify github@worldbank.org of my departure.
I agree that I will keep my password secure; I will not share the user account with others and will not delegate administrative capabilities to non-World Bank Group staff.
I certify that I have read all the above and agree to the World Bank Group’s rules for accessing its GitHub.com repositories.

Name:

Github account name:
```

**3. Creating repositories**

- To create a repository in the World Bank GitHub group, send the following email to your manager and to [github@worldbank.org](mailto:github@worldbank.org) with the subject line "Approval Required: Create GitHub Repository [NAME]".

```
Hi [MANAGER], can you please approve the following request for GitHub repository creation:
 
Repository Name:

Repository Description/Purpose: 

Team Name: 

Team Maintainer: 

I am aware that my employee named above as "Team Maintainer" is requesting creation of a code repository in the World Bank Group's Github.com site, for the purpose described above. This site allows for the publishing and public consumption of reproducible research and code. I agree that I have read the rules applicable to such access and agree to assist in upholding them to the best of my ability.

Manager's Name: 
```

- The manager should reply to the email with a confirmation of approval and the GitHub team will then notify you when the repository is open.

- Repositories are private by default. If your repository will contain research code that is not ready to be shared with the world (e.g. data cleaning, exploratory analysis), you'll probably want to keep it that way.

- If the content of the repository can be public, it's occasionally easier to create it using your personal account. However, if you are creating a repo to share commands, or templates, or apps created as part of your project, or the replication folder for a paper, you may want it to be linked to the World Bank group so people can find it without having to look for your username.

**4. Cloning GitHub repos to your computer**

- Click `Clone or download` on your repo's main page, then `Open in Desktop` and `Allow`. It's best practice to have your GitHub folder on your local computer, not in Dropbox, and sync changes using GitHub Desktop. If you insist on having this folder on Dropbox, please get in touch with the Data Coordinators to discuss the details on how to do it.

- [This presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mvf895eofw0ok3o/Git.pdf?raw=1) gives full details on how to sync a Git repo for the first time. 

## Hiring Support

DIME Analytics has recently concluded the Spring 2018 Recruitment Drive. Until the next Recruitment Drive launches, we supports the ad-hoc administration of the DIME Technical Tests for Research Assistant and Field Coordinator candidates as needed. Please contact [dimeanalytics@worldbank.org](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org) for more details.

## Code Review

**Pre-publication Code Review**

When you submit a working paper for internal review, DIME Analytics will support review and release of the reproduction data and code via the [World Bank GitHub](https://github.com/worldbank). The goal is to ensure that working papers by DIME are fully reproducible. To complete this review, please submit the following to [dimeanalytics@worldbank.org](mailto:dimeanalytics@worldbank.org) alongside the submission of the working paper to the peer review process (currently organized by Dan Rogger):

1. The working paper submission, including tables and figures
1. The directory that reproduces the results exactly, including:
    - The master do-file
    - All dofiles required to produce results
    - The data required to produce the results
    - The TeX file that compiles the tables and figures (if applicable) 

**Review Requirements**

We are happy to review code for both reproducibility and any other requests the team may have, given reasonable notice and time constraints. The best method is to share a Dropbox folder or GitHub repository with all the necessary code and documentation included. In either case, the shared folder should be freshly created specifically for the review. There are some basic reproducibility requirements we enforce before beginning detailed code review, so it is usually good for the programming team to verify the following before submitting:
 
1. The “master” do-file is contained in the root directory of the shared folder and is the only do-file there;
1. There is one line in the master do-file that needs to be adjusted to set the location of the root directory; and
1. If this line and only this line is adjusted, then running the master do-file will correctly reproduce all materials from the project.
 
Once we verify that the code structure as a whole is fully reproducible in this sense, we will go on to review the code itself in the order suggested by the master file and provide any general suggestions, or address any specific questions about the code that the submitting team may have. Let us know if you might need any other information to prepare a package for review. Once received, DIME Analytics will edit *only* that top-level directory global in the master do-file and run it to reproduce the results. This portion of the code should be marked out as illustrated below:

```
   * ******************************************************************** *
   *
   *       PART 1:  PREPARING FOLDER PATH GLOBALS
   *
   *           -Set the global box to point to the project folder
   *            on each collaborators computer.
   *           -Set other locals that point to other folders of interest.
   *
   * ******************************************************************** *

   * Users
   * -----------

   *User Number:
   * You                     1    //Replace "You" with your name
   * Next User               2    //Assign a user number to each additional collaborator of this code

   *Set this value to the user currently using this file
   global user  1

   * Root folder globals
   * ---------------------

   if $user == 1 {
       global projectfolder "/Users/bbdaniels/GitHub/dime-msie-track2-solutions/"
   }
```
The order of the outputted tables and figures should be obvious from the way they are named and organized. The Analytics Team will return to you a list of reproducibility issues if any occur, as well as general (major and minor) suggestions for code improvements and places where existing programs can save time and effort for your future work, just as in a peer review.

**Public Release**

Once this is complete, if you desire we will organize a public release repository on GitHub ([such as this example](https://github.com/worldbank/Water-When-It-Counts)). This will contain all the files needed to reproduce the results, including a version of the datasets you provide, stripped to contain only the variables needed for analysis (using [exportCodebook](https://github.com/worldbank/stata/tree/master/src/exportCodebook)). *Please let us know if any other data may not be publicly released so we can remove the appropriate materials from the repository!* We will share a private repository with you once it is created, and make it public once the working paper is released.

**Peer Code Review**

It is also possible to request a review of a Research Assistant or Field Coordinator's code during the development of a project. This is recommended when a project milestone is reached, such as
- Handing over a project
- Finishing code for sampling and/or randomization
- Finishing the cleaning of a round of data collection
- Finalizing data analysis for a paper or report
- Preparing data for microdata catalog submission (more info on that in the [microdata catalog](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Microdata_Catalog) and [microdata submission checklist](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Microdata_Catalog) articles from the Wiki)

The project review is conducted by another RA or FC, and people submitting their codes are also required to review a peer's code. The goals of this exercise are to (1) make sure all work is reproducible, (2) reduce coding mistakes, (3) encourage adoption of best practices, (4) create an opportunity to learn new coding skills from other people's codes.

Project code review is currently being piloted but is expected to happen once a month. Participants will be asked to share their codes with the reviewer on a given date and will have a week to review their assigned project, following a guidelines provided by DIME Analytics.

# Public Resources

## DIME Wiki

The [DIME Wiki](http://dimewiki.worldbank.org) is a one-stop shop for [practical resources on impact evaluations](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/ie-analytics-introducing-development-impact-evaluation-wiki). The Wiki home page is organized around four primary phases in the impact evaluation life-cycle: research design, data collection, analysis, and publication. In each category, there are a list of primary articles, which the branch off to provide increasing detail. For example, under Data Collection, the article on “Questionnaire Design” provides overall guidelines on the design process, basic rules to follow, and a summary of key measurement issues. That page in turn leads to articles on questionnaire translation, piloting, programming, and types of response errors.  The sub-article on piloting links to a checklist to use to prepare for a survey pilot, and so on. Sub-articles on measurement link to previous blogposts from Development Impact, e.g. list experiments and recall bias.  
 
Cross-cutting resources focus on advice for immediately operationalizing the more abstract articles, with concrete code examples and ready-for-field (printable) checklists. For example, Randomization in SurveyCTO notes that randomization in SurveyCTO is not best practice because of lack of reproducibility, and gives extensive code examples on how to accomplish this in Stata instead.  Other pages, like ieduplicates, provide extensive documentation for quality-assurance code packages we have authored. Visit the DIME Wiki, create an account, and start editing!

## Annual FC Training

[Manage Successful Impact Evaluations](http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2018/04/09/manage-successful-impact-evaluations) is DIME's annual course designed for staff and short-term consultants responsible for managing impact evaluations in the field. The workshop is intended to improve the skills and knowledge of impact evaluation (IE) practitioners, familiarizing them with critical issues in IE implementation, recurring challenges, and cutting-edge technologies. The course covers impact evaluation tools and concepts, but the primary focus is on how to successfully manage impact evaluations in the field. Morning sessions consist of lectures and small group discussions, in which participants work together to apply what they’ve learned to an impact evaluation case study. Afternoon sessions will be interactive computer-based lab sessions, giving participants a first-hand opportunity to develop skills. Lab sessions will be offered in parallel tracks, with different options based on software preferences and skill level.

[The resources from this year's training can be found on OSF.](https://osf.io/cyekq/)

## GitHub Repositories

**ietoolkit**

[ietoolkit](https://worldbank.github.io/ietoolkit/) provides a set of commands that address different aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to [Impact Evaluations](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/ie-analytics-introducing-ietoolkit). The list of commands will be extended continuously, and suggestions for new commands are greatly appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized best practices developed at DIME (The World Bank’s unit for Impact Evaluations). For these commands, the corresponding help files provide justifications for the standardized best practices applied.

**World Bank Stata GitHub**

The [World Bank Stata GitHub](https://worldbank.github.io/stata/) is an effort to debug, polish, improve, and disseminate useful reusable Stata code that is developed during the course of work. This repository is for such useful snippets – formalized as adofiles – which automate routine data management, statistical analysis, and graphing tasks such as data import and cleaning, production of summary statistics tables, and categorical bar charts with confidence intervals.

**Stata IE Visual Library**

The [Stata IE Visual Library](https://worldbank.github.io/Stata-IE-Visual-Library/) is a repository maintained by DIME and containing example graphs on how to explore data sets and display results of Impact Evaluations using Stata.

**LaTeX Templates Library**

The [LaTeX Templates Library](https://github.com/worldbank/DIME-LaTeX-Templates) contains resources that will help you make your research more reproducible. This will save you a substantial amount of time, significantly reduce the risk for human errors when exporting results to your papers, and make your research more transparent. We have prepared exercises that will make it easy for you to start using these resources.
