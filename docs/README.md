DIME Analytics supports research workflows and best practices at DIME and creates public goods to increase the research quality for impact evaluation and development economics generally. In 2016, DIME staff supervised 15 baseline surveys and 22 follow-up surveys representing over $7.5 million in client executed funds. DIME Analytics supports DIME projects directly through training, code review and reproducibility support, and technology solutions.

We take advantage of the concentration and scale of research at DIME to develop and test solutions, first to ensure high quality of data collection and research quality across our portfolio, and, second, to make public training and tools available to the larger community of development researchers who might not have the same capabilities. The resulting products are offered to the development research community at large through software releases, structured trainings and the DIME Wiki, a comprehensive wiki with resources on all phases of impact evaluation.

Our team gathers, documents, standardizes and disseminates these produces and practices to (1) ensure that all DIME surveys follow established best practices in data analysis and research transparency and (2) keep tools, protocols, guidelines, and training materials publicly available and up-to-date in a rapidly changing field.
