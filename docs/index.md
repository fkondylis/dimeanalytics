## DIME Wiki

The [DIME Wiki](http://dimewiki.worldbank.org) is a one-stop shop for [practical resources on impact evaluations](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/ie-analytics-introducing-development-impact-evaluation-wiki). The Wiki home page is organized around four primary phases in the impact evaluation life-cycle: research design, data collection, analysis, and publication. In each category, there are a list of primary articles, which the branch off to provide increasing detail. For example, under Data Collection, the article on “Questionnaire Design” provides overall guidelines on the design process, basic rules to follow, and a summary of key measurement issues. That page in turn leads to articles on questionnaire translation, piloting, programming, and types of response errors.  The sub-article on piloting links to a checklist to use to prepare for a survey pilot, and so on. Sub-articles on measurement link to previous blogposts from Development Impact, e.g. list experiments and recall bias.

Cross-cutting resources focus on advice for immediately operationalizing the more abstract articles, with concrete code examples and ready-for-field (printable) checklists. For example, Randomization in SurveyCTO notes that randomization in SurveyCTO is not best practice because of lack of reproducibility, and gives extensive code examples on how to accomplish this in Stata instead.  Other pages, like ieduplicates, provide extensive documentation for quality-assurance code packages we have authored. Visit the DIME Wiki, create an account, and start editing!
