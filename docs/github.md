# GitHub

DIME-based projects are encouraged to use Git, a [version control](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668) software, for maintaining code projects. To support this, DIME team members can join the [World Bank GitHub group](https://github.com/worldbank/), and the desktop clients [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) and [GitKraken (recommended)](https://www.gitkraken.com) are supported on World Bank computers. They allow simultaneous editing and execution of code files, including merging workstreams without conflicts, unlike Dropbox.
Here's how to sign up:

**1. Create a GitHub account**

- If you do not already have a GitHub account, open one at [this link](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). You don't need to use your World Bank e-mail and you can use an account you already have to become a member of this group.

**2. Join the World Bank GitHub group**

- Complete the World Bank GitHub.com Pilot MOU below, and email it to the World Bank GitHub team at [github@worldbank.org](mailto:github@worldbank.org) with the subject line "Request to Join World Bank GitHub Group - [YOUR NAME]". They will add you to the group and notify you.

```
World Bank Group Staff GitHub.com Pilot MOU:

I am aware that I am requesting access to the World Bank Group's GitHub.com group and any associated public and private repositories within that group.
I am aware that GitHub.com is an open source platform and that potentially any data uploaded could become available to the public.
I am aware that private repositories should be for working drafts of non-sensitive information only that are not yet ready for public viewing.
I agree not to post any confidential or sensitive information on any public or private GitHub.com repository.
I agree not to make public any repository without first consulting github@worldbank.org, and following any procedures then suggested.
I agree that I will comply with all relevant copyright laws and will not post copyrighted material to which I do not have release to do so.
I agree to maintain backups of any data I upload into a repository locally, and that these are updated at least once a month while the project is still active.
I agree that upon my departure of World Bank Group employment that I will remove any associated worldbank.org email addresses associated with my account, and notify github@worldbank.org of my departure.
I agree that I will keep my password secure; I will not share the user account with others and will not delegate administrative capabilities to non-World Bank Group staff.
I certify that I have read all the above and agree to the World Bank Groupâ€™s rules for accessing its GitHub.com repositories.

Github account name:

**3. Creating repositories**

- To create a repository in the World Bank GitHub group, send the following email to your manager and to [github@worldbank.org](mailto:github@worldbank.org) with the subject line "Approval Required: Create GitHub Repository [NAME]".

```
Hi [MANAGER], can you please approve the following request for GitHub repository creation:

Repository Name:

Repository Description/Purpose:

Team Name:

Team Maintainer:

I am aware that my employee named above as "Team Maintainer" is requesting creation of a code repository in the World Bank Group's Github.com site, for the purpose described above. This site allows for the publishing and public consumption of reproducible research and code. I agree that I have read the rules applicable to such access and agree to assist in upholding them to the best of my ability.

Manager's Name:
```

- The manager should reply to the email with a confirmation of approval and the GitHub team will then notify you when the repository is open.

- Repositories are private by default. If your repository will contain research code that is not ready to be shared with the world (e.g. data cleaning, exploratory analysis), you'll probably want to keep it that way.

- If the content of the repository can be public, it's occasionally easier to create it using your personal account. However, if you are creating a repo to share commands, or templates, or apps created as part of your project, or the replication folder for a paper, you may want it to be linked to the World Bank group so people can find it without having to look for your username.

**4. Cloning GitHub repos to your computer**

- Click `Clone or download` on your repo's main page, then `Open in Desktop` and `Allow`. It's best practice to have your GitHub folder on your local computer, not in Dropbox, and sync changes using GitHub Desktop. If you insist on having this folder on Dropbox, please get in touch with the Data Coordinators to discuss the details on how to do it.

- [This presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4cq44p8aw64x6kq/3_Git_Repos.pdf?raw=1) gives full details on how to sync a Git repo for the first time.
