#### Uploading and storing data in the cloud:

If you will upload and/or store data in the cloud, then please answer these questions:

* Will you store the data as _files_ or in a _database_? If database, do you have a preference for which database or which type of database?
* Roughly, how much data will you store? A few GBs? Hundreds of GBs? Several TBs?
* Where does the data come from?
    * Will you upload data from your computer?
    * Will the cloud resource access the data from an API?
    * Will a script in the cloud generate the data through, for example, web scraping?

#### Processing data in the cloud:

If you need to run any scripts in the cloud to, for example, analysis of data, generation of data (web scraping etc.), preparing the data (generating a sub-set or aggregated version of the data for easy download), then please answer these questions:

* Are you using a proprietary programming language like Stata, or non-proprietary like Python or R?
* How often does the script needs to run? What decides when it runs? Pre-set time intervals or user triggered?
* What processing power will you need in terms of processor and RAM memory? If you are running anything your laptop is powerful enough to run, then do not worry too much about this question.

#### Accessing data in that cloud:

If you are have data in the cloud that us not just back-up, then please answer these questions:

* How will this data be accessed? And how frequently?
* Does everyone in the research team need access to all data? For example, if you have a very large data file or data base, can an aggregated version of the data be generated that the research team access, or does the full research team need access to all levels of detail in the data?
* Does anyone that needs access to the data _not_ have access to a World Bank computer? Is anyone of them not World Bank Staff/ETC/STC?
