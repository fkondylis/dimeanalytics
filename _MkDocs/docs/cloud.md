* Do you need to store data in your cloud resource? If yes:
    * Will you store the data as files or in a database? If database, do you have a preference for which data base?
    * Roughly, how much data will you store? A few gigabytes? Hundreds of gigabytes? Several terabytes?
    * Where does the data come from? For example, will you upload data from your computer? Or will the cloud resource access the data from an API? Or will a script in the cloud resource generate the data through, for example, web scraping?
    * How will you use the data during the analysis? If you know, how will the data be accessed? And how frequently?
* Will you run scripts or code in your cloud resource? If yes:
    * Are you using a proprietary programming language like Stata, or non-proprietary like Python or R?
    * Will you run anything that a laptop can not easily can run?  If yes:
        * What processing power will you need in terms of processor and RAM memory?
* Does anyone but you need access to the cloud resource (generally, the cheapest options have stricter access requirements)? If yes:
    * Does anyone of them _not_ have access to a World Bank computer?
    * Is anyone of them not World Bank Staff/ETC/STC?
