The goal is to ensure that working papers by DIME are fully reproducible. To complete this review, please submit the following to dimeanalytics@worldbank.org alongside the submission of the working paper to the peer review process (currently organized by Dan Rogger): The working paper submission, including tables and figures Filenames for tables and figures must correspond to the paper The directory that reproduces the results exactly, including: The master do-file, which we will run Dofiles required to produce result All data required to produce the results The TeX file that compiles the tables and figures (if applicable) Review Requirements We are happy to review code for both reproducibility and any other requests the team may have, given reasonable notice and time constraints. The best method is to share a Dropbox folder or GitHub repository with all the necessary code and documentation included. In either case, the shared folder should be freshly created specifically for the review. There are some basic reproducibility requirements we enforce before beginning detailed code review, so it is usually good for the programming team to verify the following before submitting: The \u201cmaster\u201d do-file is contained in the root directory of the shared folder and is the only do-file there; There is one line in the master do-file that needs to be adjusted to set the location of the root directory; and If this line and only this line is adjusted, then running the master do-file will correctly reproduce all materials from the project. Once we verify that the code structure as a whole is fully reproducible in this sense, we will go on to review the code itself in the order suggested by the master file and provide any general suggestions, or address any specific questions about the code that the submitting team may have. Let us know if you might need any other information to prepare a package for review. Once received, DIME Analytics will edit only that top-level directory global in the master do-file and run it to reproduce the results. This portion of the code should be marked out as illustrated below: * ******************************************************************** * * * PART 1: PREPARING FOLDER PATH GLOBALS * * -Set the global box to point to the project folder * on each collaborators computer. * -Set other locals that point to other folders of interest. * * ******************************************************************** * * Users * ----------- *User Number: * You 1 //Replace \"You\" with your name * Next User 2 //Assign a user number to each additional collaborator of this code *Set this value to the user currently using this file global user 1 * Root folder globals * --------------------- if $user == 1 { global projectfolder \"/Users/bbdaniels/GitHub/dime-msie-track2-solutions/\" } The order of the outputted tables and figures should be obvious from the way they are named and organized. The Analytics team will return to you a list of reproducibility issues if any occur, as well as general (major and minor) suggestions for code improvements and places where existing programs can save time and effort for your future work, just as in a peer review. Public Release Once this is complete, we can help to organize a public release repository on GitHub ( such as this example ). Let us know if you would like to do this and we are happy to help you set this up. Many journals now require data and code to be made publicly available, and the World Bank GitHub is a great place for this. Peer Code Review It is also possible to request a review of a Research Assistant or Field Coordinator's code during the development of a project. This is recommended when a project milestone is reached, such as - Handing over a project - Finishing code for sampling and/or randomization - Finishing the cleaning of a round of data collection - Finalizing data analysis for a paper or report - Preparing data for microdata catalog submission (more info on that in the microdata catalog and microdata submission checklist articles from the Wiki) The project review is conducted by another RA or FC, and people submitting their codes are also required to review a peer's code. The goals of this exercise are to (1) make sure all work is reproducible, (2) reduce coding mistakes, (3) encourage adoption of best practices, (4) create an opportunity to learn new coding skills from other people's codes. Project code review is currently being piloted but is expected to happen once a month.

Dropbox DIME members are allowed to utilize Dropbox on personal and World Bank computers. Contact DIME Analytics to request an installation on a Bank machine, or start using your personal machine right away. Stata & R DIME has a Stata MP license for use on Bank and personal laptops. R and RStudio are free, and we additionally have a powerful RStudio Server and Shiny installation we can provide access to. Contact DIME Analytics for details. SurveyCTO DIME Analytics administers the World Bank's enterprise subscription with SurveyCTO . This installation is available to all Bank teams at a discount from the retail subscription and uses Bank single-sign-on when possible as well as allowing external email accounts. Please review the World Bank SurveyCTO Documentation and use eServices to request a server. To be added to the DIME Team for survey template sharing, please contact DIME Analytics. Git & GitHub DIME projects are encouraged to use Git , a free version control software , for writing data analysis code. They allow simultaneous editing and execution of code files and comparisons of hisotries and alternate versions. This enables maintaining and merging simultaneous ongoing workstreams without conflicts, unlike software like Dropbox. Learn more here. LaTeX LaTeX is a text-based typesetting language. It can support full version control with Git, simultaneous online editing, or collaboration over Git/GitHub. Overleaf is an online collaborative LaTeX editor that works much like Google Docs and includes a very useable rich-text editor. TeXStudio is a desktop-based suite that works well with Git and is available for self-installation. Both allow the use of BibTeX for reference management, which pandoc can translate into correctly cited Microsoft Word documents (and much more!) using the Citation Styles library : pandoc -s -o main.docx main.tex --bibliography sample.bib --csl=/.../styles/the-lancet.csl Security and Data Encryption LastPass is a free web app and software that manages your passwords. Authy is a software that enables two-factor authentication on your personal accounts. You should definitely use these both for all your personal and official data. VeraCrypt is a free encryption software that creates and manages \"virtual thumb drives\" that are inaccessible without a password. It can be used on World Bank machines to store and transfer sensitive data. Our GitHub Repositories ietoolkit ietoolkit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to Impact Evaluations . The list of commands will be extended continuously, and suggestions for new commands are greatly appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized best practices developed at DIME (The World Bank\u2019s unit for Impact Evaluations). For these commands, the corresponding help files provide justifications for the standardized best practices applied. World Bank Stata GitHub The World Bank Stata GitHub is an effort to debug, polish, improve, and disseminate useful reusable Stata code that is developed during the course of work. This repository is for such useful snippets \u2013 formalized as adofiles \u2013 which automate routine data management, statistical analysis, and graphing tasks such as data import and cleaning, production of summary statistics tables, and categorical bar charts with confidence intervals. Stata IE Visual Library The Stata IE Visual Library is a repository maintained by DIME and containing example graphs on how to explore data sets and display results of Impact Evaluations using Stata. LaTeX Templates Library The LaTeX Templates Library contains resources that will help you make your research more reproducible. This will save you a substantial amount of time, significantly reduce the risk for human errors when exporting results to your papers, and make your research more transparent. We have prepared exercises that will make it easy for you to start using these resources. Atom Atom is a powerful free text editor that has easy integrations with Git/GitHub and Stata, as well as other languages and softwares like LaTeX and Markdown. You can set it up on a personal computer with administration privileges. We are currently working on setup instructions for World Bank computers. First install Atom from https://atom.io/ . Choose any theme you like! In Atom, go to Settings and then Install and install the following two packages language-stata and stata-exec . In Settings / Packages , open stata-exec and read the instructions carefully. For Mac users : Selecting the correct Stata version should be the only step. Ask for help if you don't understand something. For Windows users : It is a bit more complicated. You need to follow these instructions. Ask for help if you don't understand something. Now open a Stata .do file in Atom and run it using the keyboard shortcuts in the stata-exec settings. The default keyboard shortcuts are slightly different than in the Stata dofile editor: shift-cmd-d (on Macs) and shift-ctrl-d (on PC) runs the whole file, and cmd-alt-d (on Macs) and ctrl-alt-d (on PC) runs only the selected code block. Let us know if you want to change these! Useful Atom Packages: file-icons : Adds icons to the project sidebar. fonts : Supports beautiful programming fonts like atom-firacode . chary-tree-view : Stops Atom from trying to open .dta and .xlsx files. indent-guide-improved : Helps you understand the structure of your code and be a better coder. minimap : Shows you a zoomed-out view of your code so you can navigate faster. zebra-stripes : Makes alternating lines different colors in the editor (very good for coding). language-latex : Provides code highlighting for LaTeX. latex : Compile LaTeX documents with Atom. (Atom can replace TeXStudio also \ud83d\ude09) hydrogen : See Stata results directly in your code. This is an advanced feature and we are happy to help you set this up. teletype : Work on the same code file at the same time with any number of other people. This is new software and can be a bit buggy but it can get you out of a pinch and is really cool.","title":"Software"},{"location":"software/#software","text":"This section lists step-by-step installation instructions for various software DIME Analytics recommends.

To start a SurveyCTO survey, visit eServices and submit a request for \u201c SurveyCTO Data Collection Platform \u201d. Requests are fulfilled within 1 business day. Each request becomes a group on the WBG SurveyCTO Enterprise server. Cost and Server Limits The cost is $99 per month per group. Each group is allowed up to 30 forms (i.e. questionnaires), 10,000 mobile submissions, 10,000 web submissions, and 2GB of storage. In eServices, the requestor will designate a \u2018Survey Administrator\u2019 for their survey. This person must have a World Bank Group email address for authentication purposes. The Survey Administrator will receive an email as soon as their group is live on the server, at which point they will be able to log on and add all other team members and assign them the appropriate profile. The additional team members can be WBG staff and consultants or trusted external partners, who will then receive an invitation to the server. WBG users will be automatically authenticated; externals will be asked to create a password on their first visit. Access and Roles The Survey Administrator will be able to manage (add/delete) users, forms, and data for their group. New users can be added using the \u201cConfigure\u201d tab. Each new user must be assigned a role, which will determine what access the user has to the server. The following standard roles are available for all groups: Form and Data Managers: can upload, move, and remove survey forms; can view and export data. Cannot manage users. Data Managers: can view and export data. Cannot manage forms or users. Enumerators: can view forms and submit questionnaires. Cannot manage users or forms, or access data. Custom roles are available on request. Help and Customer Support Extensive documentation and resources are available through the \u201cHelp\u201d menu on the server. You can download the WBG Enterprise SurveyCTO documentation here . Questions regarding the software itself (e.g. programming challenges, questions on particular features) should be addressed to SurveyCTO through the Support Center. Please make Support Center requests through the SurveyCTO server. Questions regarding the WBG Enterprise set-up specifically (start a new survey, request custom roles, etc) can be addressed to dimeanalytics@worldbank.org . Sync Client The SurveyCTO Sync Desktop application can be installed on WBG computers by local IT. To request it, use the \u201c Software Installation Request \u201d in eServices and select \u2018SurveyCTO\u2019 in the Software Catalogue. You can also download the Sync client, and license, here . Documentation, as well as sync clients for non-Windows operating systems, are available here . \u200bPlace SurveyCTO_Sync.exe into C:/WBG/ , and then copy the client.lic file into the \u201cSurveyCTO Sync Storage\u201d folder if authentication fails. By default, this folder usually ends up in Documents, but users may want to put it elsewhere. If you can't find it, open Sync, and then before trying to enter any passwords press \"Tools\" in the menubar, open Preferences, and you will be able to see where the storage folder is located. Once the file is located the folder, the user will drop the client.lic file into the folder and try to open Sync again. Then, the user will be able to close the pop-up without Sync closing. Important Notes Because this is an enterprise installation, you are sharing server space with all other surveys. For the enterprise installation to work smoothly, please make sure to follow these rules; they will be enforced by administrators. Anything you add to the server (forms, datasets, etc) must use your server prefix. For example, the \u201cDECIE_Ghana_Ag\u201d group should use \u201cDECIE_Ghana_Ag_\u201d for all dataset and surveys to avoid naming conflicts. The appropriate prefix will appear in user roles. Any datasets and survey forms added to the server should be encrypted. If this is not done, your confidential data will be visible to the Enterprise Administrators, which may violate your ethical approval agreements. Ending a Survey In the eServices form, you will indicate an anticipated end date for the survey. You will receive a reminder email 5 business days before the selected end date. If you are ready to end the survey, you must remove all forms and data and store in a secure location. Any forms or data remaining on the server on the end date will be deleted. If the survey is lasting longer than expected and you instead would like to extend, you must submit a new eServices request with the same survey name, starting on the planned end date and extending to the desired new end date. Your group will continue with no interruption.","title":"World Bank SurveyCTO"},{"location":"surveycto/#world-bank-surveycto","text":"","title":"World Bank SurveyCTO"},{"location":"surveycto/#introduction","text":"The World Bank Group\u2019s SurveyCTO Enterprise server is an on-site installation of the SurveyCTO data collection platform, managed by DECIE\u2019s DIME Analytics Group ( contact ).
