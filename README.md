Extensive documentation and resources are available through the “Help” menu on the server. DIME Analytics maintains WBG Enterprise SurveyCTO documentation on this page. Questions regarding the software itself (e.g. programming challenges, questions on particular features) should be addressed to SurveyCTO through the Support Center. Please make Support Center requests through the SurveyCTO server. Questions regarding the WBG Enterprise set-up specifically (start a new survey, request custom roles, etc) can be addressed to dimeanalytics@worldbank.org.

## Sync Installation Resources

The SurveyCTO Sync Desktop application can be installed on WBG computers by local IT. To request it, use the “Software Installation Request” in eServices and select ‘SurveyCTO’ in the Software Catalogue. You can also download the Sync client above. Download the `.zip` file if you ahve trouble with the others.

​Place the executable into `C:/WBG/`, and then copy the `client.lic` file into the “SurveyCTO Sync Storage” folder if authentication fails. By default, this folder usually ends up in Documents, but users may want to put it elsewhere.

If you can't find it, open Sync, and then before trying to enter any passwords press "Tools" in the menubar, open Preferences, and you will be able to see where the storage folder is located. Once the file is located the folder, the user will drop the `client.lic` file into the folder and try to open Sync again. Then, the user will be able to close the pop-up without Sync closing.
